about ETags

From https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/s3-faq.html
  There are several conditions where the CLI is not able to verify checksums on downloads:

  If the object was uploaded via multipart uploads
  If the object was uploaded using server side encryption with KMS
  If the object was uploaded using a customer provided encryption key
  If the object is downloaded using range GetObject requests
  
From https://teppen.io/2018/06/23/aws_s3_etags/
      For multipart uploads the ETag is the MD5 hexdigest of each partâ€™s MD5 digest concatenated together, followed by the number of parts separated by a dash.
      Example: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e-2
      hexmd5( md5( part1 ) + md5( part2 ) )-{ number of parts }


      You explicitly opt in and set signature_version = s3v4 in your ~/.aws/config file.
