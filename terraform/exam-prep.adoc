## Variables

The above mechanisms for setting variables can be used together in any combination. If the same variable is assigned multiple values, Terraform uses the last value it finds, overriding any previous values. Note that the same variable cannot be assigned multiple values within a single source.

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

Environment variables
The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)

## Validate command

Validate works at the level of checking your code for soundness, including loading modules and ensuring that variables are correctly named.

If you only want the basic syntax of a local file, consider using terraform fmt -write=false. If the formatter is unable to parse the file, it will throw an error.

This command does not check formatting (e.g. tabs vs spaces, newlines, comments etc.).

The following can be reported:

invalid HCL syntax (e.g. missing trailing quote or equal sign)
invalid HCL references (e.g. variable name or attribute which doesn't exist)
same provider declared multiple times
same module declared multiple times
same resource declared multiple times
invalid module name
interpolation used in places where it's unsupported (e.g. variable, depends_on, module.source, provider)
missing value for a variable (none of -var foo=... flag, -var-file=foo.vars flag, TF_VAR_foo environment variable, terraform.tfvars, or default value in the configuration)
